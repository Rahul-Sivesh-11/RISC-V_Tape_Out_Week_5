# Week-5-VSD-RISC-V-Tapeout-Program
`19/10/2025` to `25/10/2025`

In this experiment, we employ OpenROAD Flow Scripts to perform the Floorplanning and Placement phases of the physical design workflow for the GCD circuit. This experiment represents the progression from SPICE-level transistor design (Week 4) to the backend implementation stage, where the synthesized GCD logic is transformed into a tangible physical layout utilizing automated EDA tools.

## Objectives

- Configure the **OpenROAD Flow Scripts** environment for physical design automation.
- Perform the **Floorplan** and **Placement** phases of the backend implementation workflow.
- Progress from **SPICE-level transistor design (Week 4)** to the **physical layout** phase.
- Comprehend how synthesized logic is converted into an **actual chip layout** through EDA tools.
